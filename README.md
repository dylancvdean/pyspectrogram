# pyspectrogram
This is the visual part of the Team 17 RTS project from Montana State University, 2022-2023
The Spectrogram.build and Spectrogram.dist directories are the C source code for all of the used libraries, and the spec directory contains the working files for the plot.

Spectrogram.py is the spectrogram plotting program, and Spectrogram.bin is the binary version of this file compiled for x86 from the C source. The functiontraces are performance analysis, genspec and test3 are there to create data for plotting, and testplot is an old prototype.

To use this, just run Spectrogram.py and genspec.py at the same time.
